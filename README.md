# okg-consult-server
server for okg consult built with express js with the hope of scalability on project, staff and and gallery management, you can copy template all you need to do is create two emails, in my case support and info, I am pairing the usage with zohomail, and with this the main mail used to receive client feedbacks and enquiry as the case may be is the info it sends one to itself another to the support and the third is sent as an acknowledgement to the clients mail based on the data given in from the frontend, note that frontend should follow the manner of destructuring on backend
